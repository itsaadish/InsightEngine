# Teaching Insights Engine

A data-driven analytics dashboard for school administrators to monitor teacher performance, lesson creation trends, and institutional aggregate activity.

## 🚀 Features

- **Institutional Overview**: Aggregate stats for lessons, quizzes, and assessments across the entire school.
- **Trend Analytics**: Dynamic Area Charts showing activity trends over time (Week, Month, Year).
- **Teacher Directory**: A clean, searchable list of all educators.
- **Performance Profiles**: Deep-dive analytics for individual teachers, including class-wise breakdowns and recent activity logs.
- **URL-Based Routing**: Clean navigation structure with deep-linking support for specific reports.


## 🛠 Technology Stack

### Frontend
- **React (Vite)**: Component-based UI.
- **Recharts**: High-performance interactive data visualizations.
- **Lucide React**: Modern iconography.

### Backend
- **Node.js & Express**: RESTful API architecture.
- **Prisma ORM**: Type-safe database access.
- **PostgreSQL**: Robust relational data storage.
- **Winston**: Advanced logging and error tracking.

## ⚙️ Setup & Installation

### 1. Prerequisite
- Node.js (v18+)
- PostgreSQL database (Local or Supabase)

### 2. Backend Setup
```bash
cd backend
npm install
# Add your .env file with DATABASE_URL
npx prisma generate
npx prisma migrate dev
npm run dev
```

### 3. Database Seeding
To populate the database with initial teacher and activity data:
```bash
cd backend
node scripts/seed_db.js
```

### 4. Frontend Setup
```bash
cd frontend
npm install
npm run dev
```

## 🏗 Architecture Decisions

- **Dependency Injection (DI)**: Utilized a DI approach for highly maintainable code and following SOLID principles in the backend to decouple services from repositories, ensuring the system is highly testable and modular.
- **Layered Architecture**: Chosen over traditional MVC to decouple business logic from the transport layer. This ensures that business logic is independent of the framework and can be reused in different contexts.
- **Repository Pattern**: Abstracted data access logic through repositories, allowing for seamless transitions between different database adapters if needed in the future.
- **URL-Driven State Management**: Synchronized navigation and filtering states with the browser URL. This enables deep-linking support, consistent persistence on page refresh, and better browser history interaction.
- **Page vs Component Separation**: Adopted a strict separation where `pages/` handle routing and lifecycle, while `components/` remain pure and logic-agnostic where possible.

## 🚀 Future Scalability
- **Data Caching**: Integrating a caching layer (e.g., Redis) for high-frequency institutional analytics to minimize database hits for static timeframe data.
- **Real-time Updates**: Implementing WebSockets to push real-time updates to the dashboard when new data is ingested. For eg. Let's a teacher added a new lesson the dashboard should update the total lessons count and the trend chart should update accordingly. 
- **Granular Permissions**: Implementing a role-based access control (RBAC) system to allow for more granular permissions for different roles. For eg. A teacher should only be able to see their own data, while a principal should be able to see all data.
- **Indexing Database**: Adding indexes to the database to improve query performance.
- **Multiple Replicas**: Adding multiple replicas of the database, backend and frontend to handle high traffic.
- **Load Balancing**: Adding a load balancer to distribute traffic across multiple instances of the backend and frontend.
- **Adding Pagination for teachers List**: Adding pagination to the teachers list to handle large datasets
- **Generating Reports**: Generating reports for the dashboard in different formats like PDF, Excel, etc. Using microservices architecture to decouple the report generation logic from the main backend using message brokers to handle high throughput.
